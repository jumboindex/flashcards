## General info

This is simple flash card / quiz app I created to learn Redux as part of my Codecademy course. The apps state contains three slices: topics, quizzes and cards, with slices created using Redux Tool Kit.

# Routes

- `/new-topic` – form to create a new topic
- `/topics` – index of all topics
- `/topics/:topicId` – page for an individual topic
- `/new-quiz` – form to create a new quiz
- `/quizzes` – index of all quizzes
- `/quizzes/:quizId` – page for an individual quiz

## Technologies

- Javascript
- React
- react-router-dom
- Redux

## Setup

`npm start`

## Status

Project is: Finished

# To Test

1. Create topics
2. Create quizzes
3. Visit the page for an individual quiz and flip the cards over.
